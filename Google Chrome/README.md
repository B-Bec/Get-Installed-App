This PowerShell script is designed to copy the Google Chrome bookmarks from one computer to another. It takes three parameters: the names of the source and destination computers, and the username on both computers. The script constructs the file paths for the bookmarks file on both computers, which is located in the userâ€™s AppData directory under Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Bookmarks. It then uses the Copy-Item cmdlet to copy the bookmarks file from the source computer to the destination computer. The -Force parameter is used to ensure that the copy operation proceeds even if the destination file already exists.
