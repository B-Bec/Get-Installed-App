This PowerShell script is designed to copy the ‘Signatures’ and ‘Templates’ folders from a source computer to a destination computer. The script takes four parameters: the names of the source and destination computers, and the usernames on the source and destination computers. It constructs the file paths for the ‘Signatures’ and ‘Templates’ folders on both computers, and then uses the Copy-Item cmdlet to copy the folders. The script checks if the source paths exist before attempting to copy, and also verifies if the copy operation was successful by checking the existence of the destination paths. Before copying the ‘Templates’ folder, the script asks for user confirmation. If the user confirms, the ‘Templates’ folder is copied in the same way as the ‘Signatures’ folder. The script provides feedback on the success or failure of the copy operations.
